Translation indices:

NATIVE = -1
BRICK = 0
TAN = 1
GREY = 2
GREEN = 3
BROWN = 4
GOLD = 5
RED = 6
BLUE = 7
ORANGE = 8
WHITE = 9
YELLOW = 10
UNTRANSLATED = 11
BLACK = 12
LIGHT BLUE = 13
CREAM = 14
OLIVE = 15
DARK GREEN = 16
DARK RED = 17
DARK BROWN = 18
PURPLE = 19
DARK GRAY = 20
CYAN = 21
ICE = 22
FIRE = 23
SAPPHIRE = 24
TEAL = 25

Custom font translations can be specified by using a name instead of an index e.g. Gold.

---

The key for your value should be the exact name of the damage type. Each value follows a specific definition:

	"[font name],[font translation index/name]"
	
If only a single value is provided it's treated as a default translation to use across all fonts. Later values will
override previous ones.

	"[font translation index/name]"
	
Multiple translations can be defined per damage type based on the font.

	"[first font name],[first font translation index/name]:[second font name],[second font translation index/name]"
	
This will change the translation based off which font settings the player is using, that way damage numbers can always
look "correct" regardless of which style of font was chosen. Later values will override previous ones. This can
be mixed with the default translation to allow specific translations for specific fonts and then a default one for the rest.

---

Damage types for death and game types can be defined separately.

	[GAMENAME_][DEATH_]DAMAGETYPE
	
GAMENAME can be one of the following:
	-DOOM
	-HERETIC
	-HEXEN
	-STRIFE
	-CHEX
	
If no game name is provided that is the assumed translation to use for all games not defined. If DEATH is not specified that
translation is assumed to be used on death for that damage type as well.

The DEFAULT key also supports specific game and death translations. DEFAULT is used if no proper translations are found.
