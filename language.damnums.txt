The key for your value should be the exact name of the damage type. Each value follows a specific definition:

	"[font index/name],[font translation]"
	
If only a single value is provided it's treated as a global translation to use across all fonts. Only the first one
is accepted.

	"[font translation]"
	
Multiple translations can be defined per damage type based on font index.

	"[first font index/name],[first font translation]:[second font index/name],[second font translation]"
	
This will change the translation based off which font settings the player is using, that way damage numbers can always
look "correct" regardless of which style of font was chosen. Duplicate entries in the chain will be ignored. This can
be mixed with the global definition to allow specific translations for specific fonts and then a default one for the rest.

---

Damage types for death and game types can be defined separately.

	GAMENAME_[DEATH_]DAMAGETYPE
	
GAMENAME can be one of the following:
	-DOOM
	-HERETIC
	-HEXEN
	-STRIFE
	-CHEX
	
If no game name is provided that is the assumed translation to use for all games not defined. If DEATH is not specified that
translation is assumed to be used on death for that damage type as well.

The DEFAULT key also supports specific game and death translations. DEFAULT is used if no proper translations are found.
